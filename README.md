# Stellarator

An Atari 2600 emulator.
Work in progress...

It'll run Adventure if you have the rom. Try:
stack build && stack exec Stellarator-exe -- -f adventure.rom

As you can see, there are visual artifacts and the aspect ratio isn't right yet.

Use cursor keys to simulate the joystick and the space bar to fire the trigger.

Also:

C - Game Select
V - Reset

Don't press any other keys

Use mouse click to get info about graphics registers for the selected pixel.
